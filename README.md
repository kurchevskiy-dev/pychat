# pychat
This is my own web-chat on python. It's uses Flask and Requests library. First project, so im glad to see it works.

Hey! If you want to use this chat on Windows, you can open server.exe and then messenger.exe. It works on local address 127.0.0.1:5000.
If you use any Unix system (as Ubuntu, MacOS) you can run server.py and then messenger.py.*

*You need the Python 3.7- and installed Flask and Requests, if you dont have them, just type in console:
>> pip install Flask
>> pip install requests

Now you rdy to use it. Have fun!

PS. Of course you can run it on your own server, so you need to change IP-addresses in messenger.py and server.py.
